%% Intro
A new erlang application called reverse_proxy


%% Testing
Run tests from the command line like this:
./rebar eunit

Note that after running tests, I get:
=ERROR REPORT==== 30-Jan-2012::22:49:03 ===
** Generic server inet_gethost_native_sup terminating 
** Last message in was {'EXIT',<0.71.0>,killed}
** When Server state == {state,inet_gethost_native,undefined,<0.71.0>,
                               {local,inet_gethost_native_sup}}
** Reason for termination == 
** killed

This should be fixed by:
